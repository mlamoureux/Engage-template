\subsection*{Relationship to other Research Support}

On this one page, indicate any other research support you have (from NSERC and other sources) and explain their connection to this project. There may indeed be no connection at all, but you should give the title of the other grant(s), funding source(s), term of the grant(s), and describe what the other support is for. Then explain how it is or is not not connected to this project. Something like a paragraph for each grant is appropriate.
