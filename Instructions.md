This folder is a collection of template files for creating an NSERC Engage Grant. 
Please refer to the NSERC webpages for detailed information on creating an application. 
Herein is a simple sample and templates to facilitate the rather lengthy process of creating a complete application.

The application consist of three forms.
- Form 100, which is essentially a CV of the applicant
- Form 101, which is the grant proposal for an Engage Grant
- Form 183A, which is the supporting documents from the industrial partner.

Form 100 is in fact an old version of the academic CV that researchers used to fill out in applying for a Discovery Grant. Currently, researchers use the Canadian Common CV (CCV) for their Discovery Grant. However, for the NSERC Research Partnerships Program and the Engage Grant, you must use Form 100. 

Form 100 is long and complicated. You might want to give yourself plenty of time to complete it. This folder does NOT have the templates for the Form 100. (However, the TeX templates for portions of Form 101 might be useful to you.)

Form 101 is the research grant proposal for the Engage grant. 

There are several sections. Some require direct text entry into the online systems. Others require a separate PDF document to be uploaded onto the system. There are 7 such PDF documents. In this folder are several LateX templates that you can use to create the required PDFs. We use LateX because it supports mathematical symbols, and it is easily formatted to meet the rigid format requirements of NSERC. 

Here is a summary of the sections

    Application Profile  
    Area(s) of Research
    Certification/ Requirement
    Summary of Proposal
    Proposal  (PDF to upload, max 2 pages. Item 1 in the template. )
    References (PDF to upload, max 1 page. Item 2 in the template.)
    Proposed Expenditures
    Budget Justification (PDF to upload, max 1 page. Item 3 in the template.)
    Research Support (PDF to upload, max 1 page. Item 4 in the template.)
    Contrib. from Orgs.
    Contrib. from Orgs. Attachment (PDF to upload, no page limit. Item 5 in the template.)
    Other Documents (PDF to upload, no page limit. Item 6 in the template.)
    Environmental Impact (PDF to upload, no page limit. Item 7 in the template.)
    University Comments
    Access Manager
    Proactive Disclosure (for info only)

You just go through each section one by one, reading the instructions and typing in the appropriate information. For the 7 PDF files, you need to read the instructions online, and create the PDF document first before uploading to the webpage. Use the LateX templates to create the documents (edit, and run Tex) then upload them one by one. 


There is also a separate form for the industry partner, called Form 183A. However, you (the academic researcher) might find it faster to fill out the form for the company, and have them sign off on the documents. NSERC allows this. 

Form 183A has the following sections, which can completed by the company or by the academic applicant. 


    General Information
    Addresses
    R&D Activities
    Applicant Information
    Contributions
    Statement of Partner Eligibility (PDF to be attached. Item 11 in the templates)
    Letter of Support  (PDF to be attached. Item 12 in the templates)
    Company Profile (a brochure or pamphlet to be attached. Item 13 in the templates)
    Annual Report  (may be requested by NSERC, but nothing to be attached at first)
    Link Manager (to link the form 101 to this form)
    Proactive Disclosure (for info on disclosure)

As with the Form 101, you just go through section by section, filling out the relevant information and attaching the 3 PDFs files that are required. 

When you are all done, you use the Link Manage to attach the form 100, 101 and 183A together, and submit to the universityâ€™s Research Services department for comments and approval
