In this section, you must detail any direct environment impact that the project will have. NSERC has specific rules rules on funding for project that could hurt the environment, so read the rules and report as appropriate. 

For a math or stat project that involves working at a desk and accessing data, there are typically no environmental concerns to report. However, if the project involves going out into the field to collect data, then likely there is an environmental aspect to consider and report.
